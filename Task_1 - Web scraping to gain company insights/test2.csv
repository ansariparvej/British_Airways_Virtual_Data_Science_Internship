4," |  Care and support shocking. Written by a previously loyal BA traveller. Lies and misleading unprofessional service. Told that my flight was cancelled. Booked on to next available flight in downgraded cabin from business to premium economy. Called to ask why. Told technical fault with my original flight. My suspicion was another reason. At airport, check in staff said that not enough crew to staff original flight earlier in day. Why take my money and allow me to book a flight which would have allowed me to get to work as a doctor in the first place! How can you trust such an organisation to look after you as a flying customer."
10," |  I arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in, go through security, etc. All that went without any issues. Being that I was relatively early at the gate, I was one of the first passengers there. After some time boarding had opened. First the business class got called up, then families with children and disabled people. A couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people, one by one, by name. Then there was an announcement: they won’t let anyone in anymore. Me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in. The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). After the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn’t be let in anymore. Nothing changed and everyone was sent away. I had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the plane. First I tried to get my luggage back which I didn’t receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel. Then, just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane, I wanted to talk to someone from British Airways. Since they don’t have a service center at Frankfurt Airport everyone went to the check-in counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyone’s flight nor get anyone refunded. All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund. I waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today. Trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation. After the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the check-in counter to get a confirmation from them that I will receive a refund. Being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened. When they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault I could not attend the flight. It looked like I had missed it. For everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same. But the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it. Later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it. We are supposed to get an email at some point in the future. I was not able to get a written confirmation that I will get refunded even after several times asking for it. I already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me. Not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way. In the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which I would not know if I ever got it backed."
35," | I chose British Airways especially because I was going to travel with my niece and nephew, and wanted everything to work well. What a disaster! First, it took me two hours to do the check-in online due to a technical problem. I also had to spend more than 20 minutes in a call to a UK number from my Spanish cell phone because that’s the only service they provide on weekends. Then, at the airport, when there was the boarding time, we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on. They just told us to wait. Finally we could access the plane. After 40 minutes inside, they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled. We had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours. Then, do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off, which was again delayed! We spent almost 12 hours at the airport. No information was provided, no solutions were offered. We had to seat in the last raw (when I had paid to seat on the first half of the plane). No money was refunded no apologizes or compensation was given. I also had pre-purchased food and they couldn’t provide the service. All in all, terrible. Never again!"
48," |  In Nov 2022 I booked and paid for a return journey to New Zealand. On my return journey my final flight was from London to Edinburgh. On trying to check in I was told my ticket ‘did not exist’. I showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticket. My only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost £265.07. Since Nov 22, ie, 8 months ago, I have communicated multiple times with BA in an attempt to have my money returned. They have admitted responsibility for their error which cost me £265. I finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of £32.14. I have asked for an explanation but have received none, only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was checked and was correct. I do not intend to let this matter go. A company worth billions of pounds will not return an honest refund. PS, they also lost my luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve it. I tracked it down myself a week later to Edinburgh airport and picked it up myself."
73, | Flight at 8.40am from DUB to LCY cancelled 1155pm night before. No text message. No phone. Waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option. Hang on? What’s this! It was dark at 5am. It was hard to see mobile phone screen. I’m still jet lagged. Only option was to LHR at 9.20am. Tried calling. No one there. So accepted it. But I didn’t see the day change! It was the next day! I didn’t want the flight (as was staying at Docklands hence choosing LCY but thought I better take it as it’s leaving an hour after the original flight. Nope. I better call to say hey sorry I screwed up. Your flight is not going to work for me. I don’t have any more accommodation in Dublin and I don’t want to waste one night in London. Called. The most surly customer service (can you even be called that when you treat people like this) answered. She kept calling me James (not my name). She was brutal. You accepted it. I can’t do anything. She basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. She kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen. But if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn’t you call? You are at fault. Just so callous and uncaring. She wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change fees. I said nope and booked a flight today with Ryanair. Plus I need to find my way from Gatwick to Docklands. More money from me because of BA’s utter contempt for their passengers. I’ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuff. But never this level of cruelty because of one simple error. Never again. How do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude? Welcome to the U.K.! Just wow.
88,"|  My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Overall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with. I will never book with this company again. I would rather pay more money for a ticket in a different airline than buy through this company again."
91,"| Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done."
99," |  
The flights were all on time, except Belfast from London which never is. The Staff were efficient. My issue is the App, I could not book seats to Tel Aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay. So ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight. The seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so I wasted my money on PE seat! You can get hold of BA customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just won't use them again."
102," |  I booked business class tickets for my fiancé and I. I had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change, so I called to get have my flight refunded. The representative on the phone informed me he wasn't sure how much I would get, as the refund department needed to check, but estimated I would lose 10-20% of my booking to fees. I accepted. I never got a cancellation email, or any update, but instead received $35 total back. Less than 1% of my booking costs. Since then I have spent over 5 hours calling different departments before they blocked me. I've lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show."
113,"|  They changed our Flights from Brussels to London Heathrow to LAX on 4/16/2023. We paid extra to choose our seats. Since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought, they seated us in totally different seats. I asked the check in employee, she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight. From London to LAX was worse, nobody in the airport help us. Employees from BA told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal 3 and sleep there. Finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel. It was a nightmare this airline. We missed one day work and BA didn’t return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats."
117," |  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handling. Do not waste your money on Club Europe, standards just keep dropping. "
122, |  Worst aircraft I have ever flown. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over &1000each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a 10 hour+ flight is not acceptable. My food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile. I would not entertain using BA again. Ground staff were great it’s the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down. We expected so much more.
137,"| I was meant to fly in January to Algeria. I paid over £300 for the ticket. Just a few days before I was meant to fly, my wife broke her foot. I had to then rebook it in March and pay another £100. I called British Airways 3 weeks before my flight in March and I told them again that it had to me rebooked, as my wife was still not well. They told me that I don’t have to pay anything to get it rebooked as I sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn’t well. However, they never sent me the ticket. They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either £316 on top of the £450 that I paid previously. Or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of £80. (Tax only). I found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money I previously paid. Each time I call them, they hang up on me; or they continue telling me to pay £360. I made a complaint, and nothing happened."
161,"|  Flew premium, only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room. Penny pinching means there’s no other benefit - one drink service on 10 hour flight, no fizz offered before take off, poor food, boarding was badly organised. Food left on tables 30 min before landing with no tea and coffee offered. Few small cups of water passed around but nothing “premium” about this. New planes have been decorated terribly - feels like you’re in a dentist waiting room. Devoid of any personality or joy. Only fly if the only option, only fly premium if it’s not too expensive - seriously not worth much more than economy these days, especially if you’re in the middle 4."
185,"|  As a Spanish born individual living in England, I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades, multiple times a year. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago)."
189,"|  I find BA incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers. I have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although I know it sounds silly - when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage. There was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug, when I challenged why I had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - I was told it was a short haul fight. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their phones. BA I now realise stands for Budget Airline. Staff were great - what you got for your money not so much."
201," |  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for. "
239," |  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain."
261,"|  This review is for BA booking system not a flight . Today I clicked wrong date on line, my mistake and expect to pay a fee. I then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher, immediately I received a response saying my voucher is on its way. I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when. So they now have my money and I have to re-book at full cost. In the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up."
263," |  Our flight in March 2022 from San Francisco to London on 28th March was cancelled with 3 hours’ notice. We found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. We had to stay overnight for the next day flight. We still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. It is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed. It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. We returned home with Aer Lingus with no drama."
273," |  Holidays ruined, 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights I travelled from London Heathrow to Amsterdam with my brother, before boarding we were told we couldn't take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin, so they sent them to the cargo. At our arrival in Amsterdam, one of the suitcases was missing, left at London Heathrow, so we had to fill in a report in Amsterdam, this was 3 days ago and we still don't have the suitcase or any information about it. Today I travelled from Amsterdam to London City Airport, again they didn't allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when I arrived in London, the suitcase was missing, left in Amsterdam. 2 Suitcases, 2 different flights, they've ruined my holidays. No compensation, no dates on when will I get my property back, no information, lies and more lies.  I was told I could complain online and buy all the things I need, shoes, toiletries, clothes, and I might receive the money back in 30 days! Yes, I might."
288,"| Nairobi to New York via London. British Airways has given me such grief, trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away, they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking. It is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight, and I have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours I have spent on hold, or with an agent, being told that my query has been prioritized and that I will receive a call back within 48 hours. I call every 2-3 days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation. I will never book with BA again. Sure, flying with them is easy, but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time. And to think I spent more money on a ticket with BA than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier. BIG MISTAKE"
291,"|  I booked a flight for myself and my wife from Heathrow to Nairobi in Premium Economy using Frequent Flyer points. I then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own, in a 2-4-2 configuration cabin, as I didn't want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible. A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. When I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles. When I asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation, they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable. I read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats, but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable."
293,"|  Was going from Belfast to London but they cancelled the flight, and we didn’t even know it was cancelled. Someone behind us had to tell us. we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of money on our holiday. the refund takes ages. Overall not happy at all. "
325," |  BA says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs. That reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8 hours after booking, I need to change my flight. I assume I will get a refund like their site says I will - that was apparently a lie. They actually give me a voucher. To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class phone line (which I am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me. They do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours."
348," |  Total chaos for departures immigration at Malaga Airport. Boarding was quick, polite welcome by cabin crew. Beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return. BA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.
"
362," |  Have not flown economy with BA for years, what a shock! Hard uncomfortable seats, small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment. Food and service appalling. 13hr plus flight, no socks, eye shades, ear plug amenity pack. And no antibacterial wipes offered. Wi-Fi advertised but not available on flight. Paid premium money for a budget airline, more akin to Easy Jet, RyanAir or JetStar. My last time travelling with BA after more than 18 years of flying with them. BA you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship Service you used to be."
403," |  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!"
408," |  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is."
423," |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill."
445,"|  What has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed. Who’d have thought BA could ever make Ryanair look like an attractive option."
450," |  Terrible customer service. Booked my flight before Covid. Couldn’t go, still can’t go as borders are still closed. I wasn’t given an option just told I have to take a voucher. Now I have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although I booked for a flight for Cayman and I still haven’t been able to go. They cannot provide the service I paid for and refuse to refund me. They are not sympathetic or understanding.  The voucher is valid for another two years, I wonder how many flights will go up by then. I wonder how many more regulations there will be. I’ve been such a good customer and feel I deserve better. "
476," |  I’ve been flying with BA for years and never had any issues. I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I’ve decided to avoid BA from now on."
482," |  I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA's unique and notorious ""fuel surcharge"" fee of $636 for using miles."
492," | Had booked the above mentioned flight. But the travel restrictions changed a week before the travel dates. The airline didn’t notify me until I learned that I could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when I went for check-in. It was a single ticket with the company and they said they didn't realise I was flying from Canada to India via London. The restrictions didn't allow any via flights but were ok with direct ones. When I booked a single ticket from Canada to India, how come they didn't realise I couldn't fly? No refund at all. Gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years, but I don't have any travel plans for the next two years. That means my money is gone? When talking to representatives, they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was 'Onetravel'. The worst experience ever with an airline. Am a frequent flyer, was trying BA for the first time but now I guess I am never going to fly with you. On my return journey, the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions didn't allow them to take me. A poor show with BA."
518,"|  I booked flights to Rome from the US and then home through London to LAX in February of this year for the 1st of August. I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outside the US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early February. I had to cancel all of our hotels, AirB&Bs, car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers. I’ve tried to reach British Airways customer service a number of times, finally got through today after an hour on hold. I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. My understanding is that BA and AA have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners, though I was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. I was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BA. I cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money and miles I paid American Airlines for this flight. I am at a loss as to what I can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that I valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund. I will never again do anything that gives revenue to British Airways."
522," |  This company is withholding my money after cancelling my flight due to the pandemic and have issued me a voucher. Even though I called to explain why a voucher is useless since we are under a travel bane. Initially, they had said no refunds, the only thing to do was get a voucher. After we had ordered they announce you can get refund if flight is cancelled and you don’t have voucher. "
523, |  Tokyo to London. 12 hours without anything to eat because the sandwich I was given was inedible. There was no bar service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hours. Total waste of money having paid for Premium Economy. I am aware it was the beginning of the Covid19 issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service from British Airways. Their attitude is unacceptable - it is all about money with them. 
529,"|  Do not accept a British Airways e-Voucher, go for a refund. I stupidly accepted 2 e-vouchers and they are a waste of time. They have no flexibility and despite the fact that BA has money and air miles belonging to me, I cannot redeem the voucher against a more expensive non air miles flight, only an air miles flight that they don't have available at the time and route I want. BA are trying every trick in the book to complicate, frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still, you can't redeem the cancelled flight voucher online, only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to 'phone them. I was a loyal Silver Card Executive Club member and still am, but after BA's approach, I will be avoiding them wherever possible in future."
536,"|  Very disappointed that BA are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid-19, effectively holding onto my money illegally. Do what’s right and make it straightforward to do it online. A voucher is not sufficient. Or get more phone operators. The virus is stressful enough without you making to check your site for updates and a 2 hour wait on the phone. Very disappointed - I expect much better from you!"
566," |  Madrid to London. I keep giving BA the benefit of the doubt, but things are getting worse not better. This A321 has cramped business class seats, no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin. Despite every statement they make about catering improvements, i simply refer to meal photos on this route in 2016 or 2017 to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost. Iberia staff in  Madrid were all very nice, cabin staff okay, but overall Club Europe is not worth the money - don't waste your money on this.  "
610," |  My husband and I used British Airways to fly from London to Paris this past August. When we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags, was charged 4 times for one bag after I was assured charges didn't go through. Have been trying to get a refund from BA since. They give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone! They have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails. I sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that I had been charged 4 times for one bag. Only 2 months later did they finally respond to the claim, claiming I had two bags and despite the fact that I sent documentation showing 4 charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through, they only saw two charges and since I had two bags they didn't owe me any money. They force you to communicate via email and then don't respond they owe me $258 USD and refuse to give me my money at this point. "
611," |  New York to London. I was on the last flight out at 11.35 pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects.  The Boeing 777 certainly showed its age. IFE screen was tiny, seat was well used. The flight time was quick (5.50 hours) and thats about it. FA is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me. The F& B was standard and not taken as I had eaten something earlier. I'm a One World Emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me. Its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier (usually followed by a drink or two). "
634,"|  BA operate daily shuttles from London to Glasgow, its a busy route and I'm sure make money plus there is no competition. However, BA flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passenger's are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed en-route from some far flung exotic location. Because I have several buses and trains to catch after I reach Glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to BA hence I'm very disappointed with the service they provide."
730," | My flight was cancelled 3 days in a row. Was flying out on Thursday and finally after days and hours of arguing with BA, I got a flight out Saturday night with Swiss Air. They on the other hand actually fly and on time. Everything about the customer service, customer relations has been terrible, hours of waiting on the phone, no answers on email. My other flights with BA this year has been delayed too. They have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of 700$. First 10 days, then 21 bank days and now we are way passed anything else that they have not transferred the money yet. So far nothing and the complaint has been turned over to CAA and the Danish Aviation Authority."
737," |  London to Larnaca. New A321neo, 4.5 hour flight. The aircraft was narrow, the food simple nothing worth spending my money. The staff was friendly but spending money on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane doesn't worth it. No entertainment onboard. It is a small plane for this duration. "
747," | A supremely awful experience from beginning to end. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided. Between this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that BA seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with IT, it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business."
784," | Madrid to London Heathrow. This was my second trip Madrid to London on British Airways since May. On this trip like the previous the plane broke down, and we waited 2.5 hours on the plane for it to be repaired whilst the temperature outside was 42 degrees. The cabin crew director offered passengers the opportunity to purchase water and other cold drinks from the bar. Only BA could try to make money out of one of its technical failures. I then waited another hour to pick up my suitcase. As I'm a silver card holder, I could access their business lounge in Madrid. I regret using it. Fortunately, this was my last ever trip on BA."
844," |  I booked a flight from Bucharest to London and return and when we were at the airport, they informed us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours (from 8am to 1pm), then another 1 hour and a half (until 2:30 pm). We lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refund. Returning to Bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about it. I understand that unforeseen situation can happen, but I have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life."
850," |  Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways."
863," |  Bridgetown to London Gatwick. Paid for a Business Class flight. The onboard service was abysmal. No refreshments offered on boarding. Dinner took three hours to be served (on a night flight). My Husband had to go to the Galley twice for his dinner requests, he’d been forgotten. I requested ‘Express’ service, which didn’t happen. Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points. All BA could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points. Really?"
877," |  Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory."
886," |  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't deserve to stay in business."
917," | Flying last Sunday from Geneva to Piladelphia via London in business class. When I arrived at the boarding gate in London to take my flight to Philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available! They overbooked! My choice was then either to fly ecenomy or to take the next flight! They just did not care about their customer. No phone call, no email, no indication at the lounge nothing until I was at the boarding gate. I kindly accepted to take the next flight. The plane was delayed by 1 hour due to technical issues. When I arrived at Philadelphia, no suitcase! No British Airways desk on arrival, it was late no one could help. I finally retrieve my suitcase 3 days later: broken! During these 3 days, it was impossible to get someone on the phone. On my flight back to Geneva, same issue! no sufficient business class seats available. It is clear that this company just don't care about their customers, they just care about their money !"
942," |  We recently flew from London to Bologna, the aircraft was full and they requested that people place their cabin bags into the hold with checked in luggage to save space. So we did, when we arrived my carry on bag which has accompanied me on many flights over the past 3 years was damaged and beyond repair or use for our further journeys. So I approached the damaged/lost baggage area, lodged a claim and provided all the evidence, explained that we were continuing to travel and needed to replace the bag asap. I was advised by the representatives to ring BA service line. Made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim. Well it is still going, despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded. They instead asked me to produce receipts from 3 years ago and then offered me half the money due to depreciation. Despite a good flight etc have this ongoing angst of the money they refused to refund."
981,"|  Nassau to London. Premium Economy on BA is a joke. Highlighted by my Friday morning 7am breakfast. A glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in plastic, Croissant and an equally sealed Banana Bread/Cake. No hot food/drink; awful. That after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in Economy. The only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area. The extra leg room was about OK but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese. BA Premium Economy - forget it. Other airlines do this better."
997," |  Aberdeen to Heathrow to connect to a flight in Gatwick the day after. During check-in using the BA app, there was a problem that I had to re-start, after that when I opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing me to add a bag in the hold. After calling BA and explaining the situation was told that the option was to pay £65 at the airport desk. What a rip off for a short flight. By curiosity I checked with Easyjet and if I had booked with them for the same day would had cost me the same to fly as the money BA asked for the bag."
1015," |  Johannesburg to London. I tend to stay with an airline as a frequent flyer and I fly business class. I have seen a change for the worst in BA service, and it does not seem to get any better. Bedding finally a decent pillow, a very good one indeed. The rest is a waste of money unless a new announced Club World seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly.  Seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things. I don't expect top food in a plane but I expect service. If you announce things, make sure you have them. On some flights Champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat. Premium economy however gets a sparkling wine.  You must eat when they order you to eat. They seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than Gordon's. You have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner. Entertainment, make sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things to view. BA offers you the most limited offer."
1020,"|  Calgary to Rome via London. My wife and I booked our 10th anniversary trip from Calgary to Rome return, with British Airways, Sept 17-27. This was my first trip in Europe, and we spent almost $8500 CAD on first class tickets. The flight Calgary to London (stopover) was ok. I got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod I was in for the next 8 hours. One would have expected more from first class, maybe another bottle of water? They asked me to fill out what I would like for breakfast on a card. I filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came. The vacation itself was great. On the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia train broke down in Naples, and we were 80 mins late. My wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. We tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, Facebook page, Google etc. We tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. My wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me in. There was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in, once my wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete. It was a computer glitch we couldn't get around.  Ultimately we arrived at the Rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in. My wife was ok and could go through but I could not. We asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. Apparently, they said it would have been different if we called before, and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made. They then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us. They gave us another number to call My wife at this point was near tears. I am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so I was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs. She was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed. The attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way. The new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour. After reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in Rome. We eventually made it home on different airlines but I have lost all respect and trust for British Airways. Like any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support."
1064," |  Paphos to London Gatwick in Club Europe. We had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed, as were many other flights, due to bad weather the previous evening in UK. We checked in on time, only to be advised that there was no lounge available for Club Europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay! Whilst we appreciate that there may not be a BA lounge it is normal that BA would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class. We were offered a €10 voucher each, due to the delayed flight!! Paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with BA, that no lounge access was available. The flight itself was OK, although two hours late. The cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli con carne and I chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dry. On arrival at Gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered, again very poor show. BA has some great assets, particularly the cabin crew, but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight Like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service' airline and in this case BA were lacking."
1141," |  I flew BA from Heraklion to Gatwick. I bought exit row seats for me and 3 others to sit together with extra leg room. I paid around £150 for that in January. We got to the airport 2 hours before departure, queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone else. I asked why. The BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. She then said we should have got there earlier. She wouldn't call BA customer service when I showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. I was told to email BA and ask them to refund me the seat cost. The flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane. She apologised and said she'd take our case up with BA customer service. I also sent in a complaint. Today is 17 days with no response and my money still not refunded. I'll never fly with them again. "
1159," |  Glasgow to Heathrow. Very disappointed in British Airways. Having been delayed by a ""partner airline"" and therefore missed the last connecting flight of the eve, BA charged me and my friend full price to rebook for the morning. Their system had not allowed me to book all the way through using my BA exec club membership so I'd had to book it as two flights. Neither BA or Loganair would take responsibility leaving us stranded at the airport for the night. Clearly, being a member of the BA exec club counts for nothing. Very bad customer service BA. Seems BA and Loganair are only in partnership to extort more money from your passengers."
1186," | I have been flying with BA for the last 32 years between Sao Paulo and London on and off but mostly BA. I have travelled in all classes except First. BA used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. Not value for money. The food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink, even in Business (I flew out Club and returned Economy plus). Staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes there. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. Service is not exclusive anymore. Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. BA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg. Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled. Instead I had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So I will in future re-think my trips to Brazil. Even if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experience. Thumbs down to BA."
1267," |  London to Düsseldorf return. Outbound flight from Londiin City was fine. Boarding was quick and smooth, flight was not too busy. Nice crew, on time departure and a breakfast tray, which I did not expect. On the flight back A319 to Heathrow and you need to buy on board. Don't understand the concept of BA. It's an incosistent product, as on the outbound flight there was service, on the inbound flight no service. They should decide, if they are a full-service airline or low cost. I understand that they are under pressure, but they are usually more expensive than Lufthansa  and a completely different story, if compared to easyjet. Easyjet is not offering any great service, but you wouldn't expect it. With BA prices are like full-service, but value for money is much worse than easyjet or Eurowings."
1276," |  Amsterdam to London. Service Ryanair wouldn't tolerate but with premium prices. Every two years or so I fly with BA, and every two years I am reminded just why I don't normally fly with them. Whilst not as bad as my previous experience (which chopped about 12 hours off a 2 day break to Milan and left me £££ out of pocket as all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived, an no, they wouldn't refund me) we were still delayed. All the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things. BA? Didn't show the delay until we should have been boarding. Get to the gate with my shopping (what else are you to do during a delay?) and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they'll put one of my bags in the hold. Even Ryanair allows a bag of duty free on. It would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that wasn't allowed. Once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyJet, Ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, BA doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. So not only was the flight delayed, but I now had to wait for a suitcase. Once we arrived at Gatwick everything went smoothly, I managed to catch the last train to my destination (unlike the previous time I'd flown with them). Additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. Do not fly BA, save your money and go with a budget airline. The colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier."
1283," |  London to New York. Aircraft was very dated, IFE poor, meal service average, no snacks, poor drinks service, crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal. Seats on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbare and we’re outdated a decade ago. The meal service has taken a severe cut in recent years. To top everything off the crew couldn’t even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest - embarrassing! When you tell BA about a negative experience they’ll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint - absolute waste of time - don’t waste your money flying BA - I’ve had far more positive experiences on Ryanair."
1355,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Toronto. By now it is nothing new anymore that the CEOs very aggressive cost cutting, affected all classes including First & Business which called “Club World” does not deserve it name, because it is simply appalling! Again it is on the cost of the customer and eventually on the aircrews who have to work harder, because there are smaller teams.  It is not surprising that BA current ranking bounced back to 40th from 26th (in 2016). Fact is that this airlines which prefers rather to invest its money in flashy nonsense commercial rather than in its products does clearly not deserve to be recommended. Once a grand airline, today just another 2 star airline like there are so many."
1363,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Sofia. Cabin crew were kind. This is the only positive thing. British Airways are now becoming as bad as Ryanair! Onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water. When I booked my flight from Heathrow to Sofia, I was told I get a free checked in bag for my baby girl. A day before my flight I decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me I need to pay for checked in bag if I want one. I told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true. I asked him to double check this and he said he already did so I had to pay for a checked bag (£30 each way) since I already had my suitcase packed. Next day, as I went to the check in at Heathrow, I was asked how many bags do I want to check in. I asked how many bags am I allowed to check in and the lady said I can check in two bags- one for my baby and the one that I’ve paid for the previous day. The thing is that I only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me I can only check one bag (if I pay for it first). After I arrived in Sofia, I rang British airways and explained everything, so they agreed they should refund the money they’ve charged me for the additional bag. They said they’ll refund the £30 for the London-Sofia flight the same day and the other £30 fee for the Sofia-London route in about a week time. A month later I checked my online banking and saw they’ve only refunded £30 for the outbound journey. I rang them and they’ve said they are sorry and they’ll refund the remaining £30 within the next 3 days. When I pointed that it should be fair and reasonable that I get a 20% discount voucher from my next flight price, they said this is something British Airways do not offer. "
1374,"✅ Verified Review |  Malaga to Gatwick. They've introduced new cabin baggage allowances. Ultimately that means everyone tries to jam their huge cases into the overhead lockers, resulting in a Ryanair-like scuffle. They now charge for food. This would be fine if it didn't take the single food trolley the entire duration of most short haul flights to get all the way down the plane. On my previous three flights with 'the new BA' we've been left for over an hour and a half (the last flight was actually over two hours) without any service. As the economy passengers are not allowed to use business class toilets, there was a long queue of passengers stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to get to the toilets at the back of the plane. On the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passengers waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take off. The cabin crew seem genuinely fed up. One of the key reasons for flying BA was their friendly cabin crew service. This has now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company, giving them no time (or energy, by the look of it) to be nice. Ultimately, if price is everything make sure you check Norwegian before you spend any money with BA. If price isn’t everything don’t fly BA."
1449,"✅ Verified Review |  London City to Dusseldorf return, flights operated on behalf of BA by Eastern Airways. The cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases. Cabin Crew must of been members of the Basil Fawlty school of Catering. The outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us. The young stewardess took our orders, then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal. The meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented. On arrival at Dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal. The arrivals boards in the airport say terminal B and we were dropped off at Terminal C. Our delivered to terminal C and we had to walk to Terminal B if you were been met. The return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that BA is becoming famous for at overseas airports. Check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to LCY and 2 hours before the flight to LHR. I can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf. As the flight to LCY may only have max 100 pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before. The check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on Club Europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle. Which looked totally out of place in uniform. The flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals, which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called Ham & Chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days. Again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has Wizz and Ryanair, in fact they have better staff than Eastern Airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process.  I was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed. On arrival at LCY it become apparent that the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind. The handling agents at LCY could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight. I did phone on Monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system. This morning I spoke to a member of senior management at Dussledorf Airport. About 4 hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport. They will be put on the late flight tonight which means I will get it nearly 4 days after it became missed. It is a pity that we cant review the ground handling agents at airports as no they would have to have to let negative results be posted."
1465,"✅ Verified Review |  Venice to Gatwick. Problems encountered on 24th July at Venice Marco Polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight BA2581 back to Gatwick. From various conversations that took place, it would appear that there were no British Airways staff at Venice Marco Polo airport; everything is handled by the local service agents. Obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents, they need to be made aware and re-trained if necessary as no doubt BA are paying them money to carry out their duties.  Announcements were unclear especially in the lounge, the departure board information did not help. After arriving at 13:00 we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost 1 hour away, arriving at 24:00. The following day, on the replacement flight, we were taxiing out and a flight-deck hold warning light came on creating further delays while that was fixed. I am all for safe flying but BA need to improve their standards."
1484,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Accra. Flight left nearly two hours late - bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure. This is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags. Ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage. Chaos in economy class. On this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure. When will BA realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board - it is the most delayed flight out of Heathrow because of this poor management. Fact. The ground staff did nothing to control the crowds - simple and polite requests would have helped. The grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers - on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite (even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers). Once on board the crew were friendly and professional. Very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment, poor food and very poor quality seats. The cold/salad options are far better than the hot offering in BA's club class. Still no wi-fi on BA? Even discount carriers like Norwegian have this now, let along the flag carriers like Emirates and Qatar Airways."
